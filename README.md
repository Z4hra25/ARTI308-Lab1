# Lab 1: Git & GitHub for ML Projects

Hi, I’m Zahra Al Ahmad!

I am a Computer Science student with a strong interest in technology and problem-solving. I’m particularly interested in Machine Learning and how it can be used to analyze data and build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

I’m looking forward to learning more about Git, GitHub, and Machine Learning throughout this course.
